# Python Lexical Analyser 

In this Lab our goal was to create a lexical analyser using any programming language. I decided to use Python to create a simple lexical analyser.

This lexical analyser scans the source, labelled source in the code, and breaks up each word into a list item. 

It can detect Strings, Operators and Integers and outputs a list showing the respective datatype and word.
